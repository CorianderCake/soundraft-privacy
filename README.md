## Privacy Policy

Soundraft does not collect, store, transmit, or share any user data.

- No tracking
- No analytics
- No personal data access
- No media downloads or transfers

All functionality runs locally in the browser and uses the Web Audio API to process audio in memory only.

In future versions, we may implement optional project sharing through metadata (no media involved). If so, this policy will be updated and the extension will be re-reviewed accordingly.

If you have any questions, please contact: [said.hdjo@gmail.com](mailto:said.hdjo@gmail.com)
